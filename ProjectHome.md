<b>Tips&Tricks:</b> <br>

2.When on the search field in the search panel, press ctrl+up or ctrl+down to switch between categories.<br>
3.You can hide any panel by pressing Esc, or simply close it with your mouse.<br>
4.When right click on an item, there will be several useful actions such as :<br>
4.a. if you choose 'Run In Browser', the item is opened in the default browser.<br>
4.b. if you choose 'Open Directory', clipall tries to open the directory, by evaluating the item as a directory in your computer.<br>
4.c. if you choose 'run as command', clipall tries to run the item as a windows cmd command. For example, if the item is 'notepad' and you press 'Run As Command', then notepad is opened.<br><br>
